Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree- Report Card

Class Design

    • Constants
		  o Any constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices 
			for constant values.
      
	  • Submission structure
		  o The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, 
			contained in a .zip file.
			
     • Constructor
          o The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates 
			each variable in the class.
	  
	  • Getters
          o Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a 
			getter method to access them.

	  • Setters
          o Any private variables that should be set by an outside class (for instance, a 
			teacher might set a student’s grade in their history class) should have a setter method.
			
	  • The toString method
          o The class contains a toString method which returns the contents of the class in a 
			human-readable string.
			
Functionality

    • Structure
          o The app contains multiple activities, each labelled, which together 
			make a cohesive music app.
    • Labelling
          o Each activity contains a TextView which explains the purpose of the activity.
    • Buttons
		  o Each activity contains buttons which link it to other activities a user 
			should be able to reach from that activity. For instance, 
			a ‘library’ activity might contain a button to move to the ‘now playing’ activity.
	• Layout Best Practices
		  o The code adheres to all of the following best practices:
				o Text sizes are defined in sp
				o Lengths are defined in dp
				o Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that 
				  the views are not crammed up against each other.
		  
Functionality

    • Compilation Errors
          o The code compiles without errors

Code Readability

    • Format
          o The code is properly formatted i.e. there are no unnecessary blank lines. 
          o There are no unused variables or methods. 
          o There is no commented out code.
          o The code also has proper indentation when defining variables and methods.
    • Naming Conventions
          o All variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively named such that 
			another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.
